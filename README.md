# Custom Grunt Plugin Boilerplate

This is a quick and dirty Grunt plugin boilerplate. You can also visit the [official guide](http://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins) at 
Gruntjs and get a sample boilerplate that way.

### Setup instructions

1. `cd` into the directory
2. `npm install`
3. Configure the `options` passed into the `custom_plugin` task within `Gruntfile.js` if you like
4. `grunt custom_plugin`
